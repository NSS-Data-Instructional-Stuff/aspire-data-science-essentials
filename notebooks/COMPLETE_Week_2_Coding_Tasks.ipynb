The `urban` column uses data from the National Bureau of Economic Research to classify each county as either urban or rural. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget designates counties as metropolitan (a core urban area of 50,000 or more population), micropolitan (an urban core of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population), or neither. Here, a county is considered \"urban\" if it is part of a metropolitan or micropolitan area and \"rural\" if it is not."
